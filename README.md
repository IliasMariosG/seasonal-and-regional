# Seasonal Regional

Seasonal regional is an app designed to allow users to make informed decisions about foods based on their envinronmental impact. Ingredients display their carbon footprint and are shown according to seasonality. Selecting an ingredient will then show a range of recipes that can be made with that ingredient. A map is shown, according to the users location, which shows local farmers markets.

## Tech
Seasonal Regional runs using Vue.js and is therefore a single page app. For database hosting, it uses Firebase.

## Credits
Seasonal Regional team: Katie Rodgers, Marcello Fabbri, Ria Patel, Ben Auld, Ilias Grigoropoulos and Jack Willee.
